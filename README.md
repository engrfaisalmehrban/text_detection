# Text Detection System 📝🤖

⚡️ **Ever Wondered How Machines Read Text from Images and Documents?** 📸📄

Well, I just cracked the code for **Text Detection** using **Python**, and I’m here to show you how! 🚀🔥

In this project, I built a **Text Detection System** that extracts text from both images and documents with cutting-edge libraries like **OpenCV**, **EasyOCR**, **Tesseract**, and **AWS Textract**. 🤖✨

## 🛠️ **Libraries Used:**
- **OpenCV**: For processing and handling images.
- **EasyOCR**: For high-accuracy text detection in complex images.
- **Tesseract OCR**: For simple text extraction.
- **Pillow**: For image handling and manipulation.
- **AWS Textract**: For extracting structured text from documents and scanned images.

## 📚 **Project Highlights:**
- Mounted **Google Drive** to access image data effortlessly.
- Applied **Tesseract OCR** for basic image text extraction.
- Integrated **EasyOCR** for enhanced text recognition with better accuracy.
- Used **AWS Textract** to process documents, pulling out text and data seamlessly.

## 🚀 **Why It’s Game-Changing:**
- **AWS Textract**: Unlocks powerful document processing capabilities.
- **Multi-Technology Approach**: Combining **Tesseract**, **EasyOCR**, and **Textract** for optimal results.
- **Quick Setup**: Leveraged **Google Colab** for easy installation and fast implementation.

💡 **Endless possibilities**: This system can be applied in automating document workflows, extracting information from invoices, forms, and even PDFs. 📝💼
